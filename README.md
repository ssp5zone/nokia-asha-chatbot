A bunch of chatbots written in J2ME for Symbian devices.

**Why?** Because Micro Edition basically uses the most primitive version of Java and cut shorted version of JVM. You pretty much write everything yourself. Hence, I forgot the point I was trying to make.

The app has 3 different bots,
1. Pandora
2. Cleverbot
3. Jabberwacky

## Build

1. Download Nokia Asha SDK.
2. Clone the repo and load in the SDK.

## Run

2. Copy to the device or emulator.

4. This should a new App named `GrayBox` in your app drawer.
